# Matrix Wargame CLI

A command-line interface for running AI-powered matrix wargame simulations. MatrixAI uses structured simulations that use systematic frameworks to explore how different actors might behave in complex scenarios, providing insights into potential outcomes and unintended consequences of various actions and decisions.

## What are Matrix Wargames?

Matrix wargames are structured simulations that use systematic frameworks to explore how different actors might behave in complex scenarios. Unlike traditional board games or computer simulations, matrix games focus on understanding the decision-making processes, motivations, and interactions between multiple stakeholders.

These games are particularly valuable for strategic planning, policy analysis, training, and research, providing insights into potential outcomes and unintended consequences of various actions and decisions. Each simulation represents realistic actors with their own objectives, constraints, and information, making decisions that create cascading effects throughout the scenario.

## Features

- **üéØ Multiple Scenarios**: Pre-built scenarios covering diplomatic crises, military conflicts, economic disputes, and more
- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Simulation**: Automated actors with distinct personalities, objectives, and decision-making capabilities  
- **üìä Structured Argumentation**: Actions are evaluated through pros/cons analysis and probability estimation
- **‚ö° Real-time Streaming**: Watch the simulation unfold step-by-step with live updates
- **üéÆ Easy CLI Interface**: Simple commands to list and run any scenario
- **üß† Advanced AI Reasoning**: Each actor uses sophisticated reasoning to make realistic decisions based on their role and objectives
- **üîÑ Dynamic Interactions**: Complex multi-actor interactions where decisions create lasting effects on the scenario

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API key (set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd matrix-wargame-cli
```

2. Create venv and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

3. Set your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Usage

**List available scenarios:**
```bash
python run_scenario.py list
```

**Run a specific scenario:**
```bash
python run_scenario.py diplomatic-crisis
```

## Available Scenarios

- **diplomatic-crisis**: A tense 3-nation diplomatic scenario (2 turns)
- **climate-summit**: Emergency climate negotiations (4 turns)  
- **trade-dispute**: Global trade war escalation (5 turns)
- **race-to-agi**: Competition to achieve artificial general intelligence (6 turns)
- **attack-on-taiwan**: Military crisis in the Taiwan Strait (8 turns)
- **corporate-merger**: $127B hostile takeover battle (8 turns)
- **cyber-attack**: Critical infrastructure attack response (10 turns)
- **supply-chain-crisis**: Global supply chain collapse (12 turns)

## How It Works

### Matrix Game Concepts

**Arguments**: Each turn, AI actors propose actions with supporting reasons (pros) explaining why they should succeed.

**Adjudication**: A critic AI identifies potential obstacles (cons), then the action is either auto-approved or evaluated probabilistically.

**Narrative Evolution**: Successful and failed actions create lasting effects that shape the ongoing story and strategic situation.

**Turn Structure**: Each turn represents a realistic timeframe (days to weeks) where actors take meaningful actions.

**Multi-Actor Dynamics**: Each AI actor has distinct objectives, resources, and decision-making processes, creating realistic interactions and conflicts.

### Example Output

```
‚è±Ô∏è  Turn 1
   üéÆ Nation Alpha's turn
   ‚ùå Launch an international diplomatic campaign to discredit satellite evidence
   üéÆ Nation Beta's turn  
   ‚úÖ Organize high-level coalition summit to maintain pressure and unity
   üéÆ UN Mediator's turn
   ‚úÖ Propose joint dialogue session focused on de-escalation measures

üèÅ Simulation completed!

üìä Final Results:
   Duration: 2 turns
   Phase: Game Ended

üìú Final Situation:
   The UN Mediator achieved a significant breakthrough by facilitating 
   a trilateral agreement on joint border monitoring...
```

## Architecture

- **`src/matrix_ai/`**: Core simulation engine with LangGraph workflows
- **`scenarios/`**: JSON scenario definitions with actors, objectives, and setup
- **`run_scenario.py`**: Main CLI interface for running simulations
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Python package configuration and dependencies

## Creating Custom Scenarios

Scenarios are defined in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Scenario Name",
  "category": "Political/Military/Economic/Environmental", 
  "description": "Brief description of the scenario",
  "introduction": "Setting the stage...",
  "background_briefing": "Detailed context and background...",
  "actors": [
    {
      "actor_name": "Actor Name",
      "actor_briefing": "Detailed role description...",
      "objectives": ["Objective 1", "Objective 2"],
      "starting_forces": [
        {
          "unit_name": "Unit Name",
          "starting_location": "Location",
          "details": "Additional details"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "victory_conditions": "How the game ends...",
  "turn_length": "2 weeks",
  "game_length": 6
}
```

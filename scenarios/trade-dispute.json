  "description": "Economic tensions escalate into a complex trade war",
  "introduction": "The dispute centers on steel, electronics, and agricultural products where Bloc B has gained significant market share. Bloc A's unemployment has risen in affected sectors, leading to political pressure for protection. Bloc B warns that any trade barriers will trigger immediate retaliation. Global supply chains are already showing strain as companies hedge against potential disruptions. Financial markets are volatile as investors await the outcome of WTO proceedings.",
  "background_briefing": "A major trade dispute has erupted between two economic blocs over allegations of dumping, subsidies, and market manipulation. Traditional industries in Bloc A claim they cannot compete with artificially cheap imports from Bloc B, while Bloc B argues their competitive advantages are legitimate. The WTO has been called in to arbitrate, but both sides are preparing retaliatory measures.",

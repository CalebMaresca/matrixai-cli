  "description": "A tense diplomatic scenario between three nations for MVP demonstration",
  "introduction": "The crisis began three weeks ago when satellite imagery revealed suspicious activities in Nation Alpha's border region. Nation Beta immediately called for emergency UN Security Council sessions and began organizing economic sanctions. Nation Alpha denies wrongdoing and claims the evidence is fabricated. Both nations have mobilized military forces 'for defensive purposes only,' while civilians in border areas flee to safer regions. The international community watches nervously as diplomatic channels strain under mounting pressure.",
  "background_briefing": "A regional crisis has emerged following Nation Alpha's alleged violation of international agreements. Nation Beta leads a coalition imposing economic sanctions, while tensions rise along disputed borders. The UN has deployed mediators to prevent escalation, but time is running short as domestic pressures mount in both nations.",
